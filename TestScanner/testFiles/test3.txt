A Discourse Upon the Origin and the
Foundation of the Inequality Among
Mankind
---
Introductory Note
Jean Jacques Rousseau was born at Geneva
, June 28, 1712, the son of a watchmaker of
French origin. His education was irregu
lar, and though he tried many professions--
including engraving, music, and teaching--he
found it difficult to s
upport himself in any
of them. The discovery of his talent as a
writer came with the winning of a prize offered
by the Academy of Dijon for a
discourse on the question, "W
hether the progress of the
sciences and of letters has
tended to corrupt or to elevate morals." He argued so
brilliantly that the tendency of civilization
was degrading that he became at once famous.
The discourse here printed on the causes
of inequality among men was written in a
similar competition.
He now concentrated his powers upon lite
rature, producing two novels, "La Nouvelle
Heloise," the forerunner and parent of endle
ss sentimental and picturesque fictions; and
"Emile, ou l'Education," a work which has ha
d enormous influence on the theory and
practise of pedagogy down to our own time a
nd in which the Savoyard Vicar appears,
who is used as the mouthpiec
e for Rousseau's own religious
ideas. "Le Contrat Social"
(1762) elaborated the doctrine
of the discourse on inequali
ty. Both historically and
philosophically it is unsound; but it was the chief literary source of the enthusiasm for
liberty, fraternity, and equality, which inspired
the leaders of the French Revolution, and
its effects passed far beyond France.
His most famous work, the "Confessions," wa
s published after his death. This book is a
mine of information as to his life, but it is fa
r from trustworthy; and
the picture it gives of
the author's personality and conduct, though
painted in such a way as to make it
absorbingly interesting, is often unpleasing in th
e highest degree. But it is one of the great
autobiographies of the world.
During Rousseau's later years he was the vi
ctim of the delusion of persecution; and
although he was protected by a succession of good friends, he came to distrust and
quarrel with each in turn. He died at Erme
nonville, near Paris, July 2, 1778, the most
widely influential French writer of his age.
The Savoyard Vicar and his "Profession of
Faith" are introduced into "Emile" not,
according to the author, because he wishes to
exhibit his principles as those which should
be taught, but to give an example of the
way in which religious matters should be
discussed with the young. Nevertheless, it is
universally recognized
that these opinions
are Rousseau's own, and repres
ent in short form his characteristic attitude toward
religious belief. The Vicar himself is believ
ed to combine the traits of two Savoyard
priests whom Rousseau knew in his youth. Th
e more important was the Abbe Gaime,
whom he had known at Turin; the other, the
Abbe Gatier, who had taught him at Annecy.
QUESTION PROPOSED BY THE ACADEMY OF DIJON
What is the Origin of the Inequality am
ong Mankind; and whether such Inequality is
authorized by the Law of Nature?
A DISCOURSE UPON THE ORIGIN
AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE
INEQUALITY AMONG MANKIND
'Tis of man I am to speak; a
nd the very question, in
answer to which I am to speak of
him, sufficiently informs me that I am going to speak to men; for to those alone, who are
not afraid of honouring truth, it belongs to
propose discussions of this kind. I shall
therefore maintain with confidence the cause
of mankind before the sages, who invite me
to stand up in its defence; and I shall think
myself happy, if I can but behave in a manner
not unworthy of my subject and of my judges.
I conceive two species of inequality among
men; one which I call natural, or physical
inequality, because it is established by nature
, and consists in the difference of age,
health, bodily strength, and the qualities of th
e mind, or of the soul; the other which may
be termed moral, or political inequality, b
ecause it depends on a kind of convention, and
is established, or at least authorized, by th
e common consent of mankind. This species of
inequality consists in the different privileg
es, which some men enjoy, to the prejudice of
others, such as that of bei
ng richer, more honoured, more
powerful, and even that of
exacting obedience from them.
It were absurd to ask, what is the cause of na
tural inequality, seeing
the bare definition of
natural inequality answers the que
stion: it would be more absu
rd still to enquire, if there
might not be some essential connection between
the two species of in
equality, as it would
be asking, in other words, if those who comm
and are necessarily better men than those
who obey; and if strength of body
or of mind, wisdom or virtue
are always to be found in
individuals, in the same pr
oportion with power, or riches:
a question, fit perhaps to be
discussed by slaves in the
hearing of their masters, bu
t unbecoming free and reasonable
beings in quest of truth.
What therefore is precisely the subject of this discourse? It is to point out, in the progress
of things, that moment, when, right taking pl
ace of violence, nature became subject to
law; to display that chain of surprising
events, in consequence of which the strong
submitted to serve the weak, and the people to
purchase imaginary ease, at the expense of
real happiness.
The philosophers, who have examined the fo
undations of society, have, every one of
them, perceived the necessity of tracing it back
to a state of nature, but not one of them
has ever arrived there. Some of them have not
scrupled to attribute to man in that state the
ideas of justice and injustice, without troubli
ng their heads to prove, that he really must
have had such ideas, or even that such ideas
were useful to him:
others have spoken of
the natural right of ev
ery man to keep what belongs to
him, without letting us know what
they meant by the word belong; others,
without further cerem
ony ascribing to the
strongest an authority over the weakest,
have immediately st
ruck out government,
without thinking of the time re
quisite for men to form any no
tion of the things signified
by the words authority and govern
ment. All of them, in fine,
constantly harping on wants,
avidity, oppression, desires and pride, have tran
sferred to the state of nature ideas picked
up in the bosom of society. In speaking of sa
vages they described citizens. Nay, few of
our own writers seem to have so much as doubt
ed, that a state of na
ture did once actually
exit; though it plainly appears by Sacred Hist
ory, that even the first man, immediately
furnished as he was by God himself with both instructions and precepts, never lived in
that state, and that, if we give to the books
of Moses that credit which every Christian
philosopher ought to give to them, we must
deny that, even before
the deluge, such a
state ever existed among men, unless they fe
ll into it by some extraordinary event: a
paradox very difficult to maintain, a
nd altogether impossible to prove.
Let us begin therefore, by la
ying aside facts, for they do
not affect the question. The
researches, in which we may engage on this
occasion, are not to be taken for historical
truths, but merely as hypothetical
and conditional reasonings, f
itter to illustra
te the nature
of things, than to show their true origin, like those systems, which our naturalists daily
make of the formation of the world. Religi
on commands us to believe, that men, having
been drawn by God himself out of
a state of nature, are unequal
, because it is his pleasure
they should be so; but religion does not forbid
us to draw conjectures solely from the
nature of man, considered in itself, and fr
om that of the beings which surround him,
concerning the fate of mankind, had they been left to themselves. This is then the
question I am to answer, the question I propos
e to examine in the present discourse. As
mankind in general have an interest in my
subject, I shall endeavour to use a language
suitable to all nations; or rather, forgetting the circumstances of time and place in order to
think of nothing but the men I speak to, I sh
all suppose myself in the Lyceum of Athens,
repeating the lessons of my masters before th
e Platos and the Xenocrates of that famous
seat of philosophy as my judges, and in pr
esence of the whole human species as my
audience.
O man, whatever country you may belong to, wh
atever your opinions may be, attend to
my words; you shall hear your history such
as I think I have r
ead it, not in books
composed by those like you, for they are liars,
but in the book of nature which never lies.
All that I shall repeat after her, must be
true, without any intermixture of falsehood, but
where I may happen, without intending it, to
introduce my own conceits. The times I am
going to speak of are very remote. How much you are changed from what you once were!
'Tis in a manner the life of your species that
I am going to write, from the qualities which
you have received, and which your education a
nd your habits could deprave, but could
not destroy. There is, I am sensible, an
age at which every individual of you would
choose to stop; and you will look out for the age at which, had you your wish, your
species had stopped. Uneasy at your present co
ndition for reasons which threaten your
unhappy posterity with still gr
eater uneasiness, you will perhaps wish it were in your
power to go back; and this
sentiment ought to be consider
ed, as the panegyric of your
first parents, the condemnation of your contem
poraries, and a source of terror to all those
who may have the misfortune of succeeding you.
Discourse First Part
However important it may be, in order to form a proper judgment of the natural state of
man, to consider him from his origin, and to
examine him, as it were, in the first embryo
of the species; I shall not
attempt to trace his organi
zation through its successive
approaches to perfection: I shall not stop to
examine in the animal system what he might
have been in the beginning, to become at la
st what he actually is; I shall not inquire
whether, as Aristotle thinks, his neglected
nails were no better at first than crooked
talons; whether his whole body was not, bear-
like, thick covered with rough hair; and
whether, walking upon all-fours, his eyes, dir
ected to the earth, and confined to a horizon
of a few paces extent, did not at once point ou
t the nature and limits of his ideas. I could
only form vague, and almost imaginary, co
njectures on this subject. Comparative
anatomy has not as yet been sufficiently improved; neither have
the observations of
natural philosophy been sufficiently ascertai
ned, to establish upon such foundations the
basis of a solid system. For
this reason, without having rec
ourse to the supernatural
informations with which we have been favour
ed on this head, or pa
ying any attention to
the changes, that must have happened in th
e conformation of the in
terior and exterior
parts of man's body, in proportion as he appl
ied his members to new purposes, and took
to new aliments, I shall suppose his conforma
tion to have always
been, what we now
behold it; that he always walked on two feet,
made the same use of his hands that we do
of ours, extended his looks over the whole face
of nature, and measured with his eyes the
vast extent of the heavens.
If I strip this being, thus constituted, of all the supernatural gifts which he may have
received, and of all the artificial faculties,
which we could not have acquired but by slow
degrees; if I consider him, in a word, such
as he must have issued from the hands of
nature; I see an animal less strong than so
me, and less active than others, but, upon the
whole, the most advantageously organized of
any; I see him satisfy
ing the calls of hunger
under the first oak, and those of
thirst at the first rivulet;
I see him laying himself down to
sleep at the foot of the same tree that afford
ed him his meal; and behol
d, this done, all his
wants are completely supplied.
The earth left to its own natural fertility
and covered with immense woods, that no
hatchet ever disfigured, offers
at every step food and shelter
to every species of animals.
Men, dispersed among them, observe and imitate
their industry, and thus rise to the
instinct of beasts; with this advantage, that,
whereas every species of beasts is confined to
one peculiar instinct, man, who perhaps has not any that particularly belongs to him,
appropriates to himself those
of all other animals, and li
ves equally upon most of the
different aliments, which they only divi
de among themselves; a circumstance which
qualifies him to find his subsistence,
with more ease than any of them.
Men, accustomed from their infancy to the incl
emency of the weather,
and to the rigour
of the different seasons; inured
to fatigue, and obliged to
defend, naked and without arms,
their life and their prey against the other wild in
habitants of the forest, or at least to avoid
their fury by flight, acquire a robust and almo
st unalterable habit of body; the children,
bringing with them into the world the excel
lent constitution of their parents, and
strengthening it by the same exercises that first produced it, attain by this means all the
vigour that the human frame is capable of. Natu
re treats them exactly
in the same manner
that Sparta treated the children of her citi
zens; those who come well formed into the
world she renders strong and robust, and destroys all the rest; differing in this respect
from our societies, in which the state, by
permitting children to become burdensome to
their parents, murders them a
ll without distinction, even in
the wombs of their mothers.
The body being the only instrume
nt that savage man is acqua
inted with, he employs it to
different uses, of which ours, for want of
practice, are incapable; and we may thank our
industry for the loss of that st
rength and agility, which nece
ssity obliges him to acquire.
Had he a hatchet, would his ha
nd so easily snap off from an
oak so stout a branch? Had
he a sling, would it dart a st
one to so great a distance? Had
he a ladder, would he run so
nimbly up a tree? Had he a horse, would he
with such swiftness shoot along the plain?
Give civilized man but time to gather about
him all his machines, and no doubt he will be
an overmatch for the savage: but if you have
a mind to see a contest still more unequal,
place them naked and unarmed one opposite to
the other; and you will soon discover the
advantage there is in perpetuall
y having all our forces at our
disposal, in being constantly
prepared against all events, and in always ca
rrying ourselves, as it
were, whole and entire
about us.
Hobbes would have it that man is naturally
void of fear, and always
intent upon attacking
and fighting. An illustrious philosopher th
inks on the contrary, and Cumberland and
Puffendorff likewise affirm it, that nothing is
more fearful than man in a state of nature,
that he is always in a tremble, and ready to fl
y at the first motion he perceives, at the first
noise that strikes his ears. This, indeed, may be
very true in regard to objects with which
he is not acquainted; and I make no doubt of
his being terrified at every new sight that
presents itself, as often as he cannot dis
tinguish the physical good and evil which he may
expect from it, nor compare his forces
with the dangers he has to encounter;
circumstances that seldom occur in a state
of nature, where all things proceed in so
uniform a manner, and the face of the earth
is not liable to those
sudden and continual
changes occasioned in it by the passions a
nd inconstancies of collected bodies. But
savage man living among other animals wit
hout any society or fixed habitation, and
finding himself early under a necessity of meas
uring his strength with theirs, soon makes
a comparison between both, and finding that he
surpasses them more in address, than
they surpass him in strength, he
learns not to be any longer
in dread of them. Turn out a
bear or a wolf against a sturdy,
active, resolute savage, (and
this they all are,) provided
with stones and a good stick; and you will soon
find that the danger
is at least equal on
both sides, and that after several trials of
this kind, wild beasts
, who are not fond of
attacking each other, will not be very f
ond of attacking man, whom they have found
every whit as wild as themselves. As to an
imals who have really
more strength than man
has address, he is, in regard
to them, what other weaker
species are, who find means to
subsist notwithstanding; he has even this grea
t advantage over such weaker species, that
being equally fleet with them, and finding on ev
ery tree an almost inviolable asylum, he
is always at liberty to take it or leave it, as he
likes best, and of course to fight or to fly,
whichever is most agreeable to him. To this we may add that no animal naturally makes
war upon man, except in the case of self-defen
ce or extreme hunger; nor ever expresses
against him any of these violen
t antipathies, which seem to
indicate that some particular
species are intended by nature
for the food of others.
But there are other more formidable enemies,
and against which man is not provided with
the same means of defence; I mean natural infirmities, infancy, old age, and sickness of
every kind, melancholy proofs of our weakness,
whereof the two first are common to all
animals, and the last chiefly attends man living
in a state of society. It is even observable
in regard to infancy, that the mother bein
g able to carry her ch
ild about with her,
wherever she goes, can perform the duty of a nu
rse with a great deal
less trouble, than the
females of many other animals, who are oblig
ed to be constantly going and coming with
no small labour and fatigue, one way to look out for their own subsistence, and another to
suckle and feed their young one
s. True it is that, if the
woman happens to perish, her
child is exposed to the greatest danger of pe
rishing with her; but this danger is common
to a hundred other species, whose young ones requi
re a great deal of time to be able to
provide for themselves; and if our infancy is lo
nger than theirs, our li
fe is longer likewise;
so that, in this respect too, a
ll things are in a manner equal;
not but that there are other
rules concerning the duration of
the first age of life, and
the number of the young of man
and other animals, but they do not belong to
my subject. With ol
d men, who stir and
perspire but little, the demand fo
r food diminishes with their ab
ilities to provi
de it; and as
a savage life would exempt them from the gout
and the rheumatism, and old age is of all
ills that which human assistance is least capable
of alleviating, they would at last go off,
without its being perceived by
others that they ceased to
exist, and almost without
perceiving it themselves.
In regard to sickness, I shall not repeat the
vain and false declama
tions made use of to
discredit medicine by most men, while they enjo
y their health; I shall only ask if there are
any solid observations from which we may co
nclude that in those countries where the
healing art is most neglected, the mean dura
tion of man's life is shorter than in those
where it is most cultivated? And how is it possibl
e this should be the case, if we inflict
more diseases upon ourselves than medicine
can supply us with re
medies! The extreme
inequalities in the manner of living of
the several classes of mankind, the excess of
idleness in some, and of labour
in others, the facility of
irritating and sa
tisfying our
sensuality and our appetites, th
e too exquisite and out of th
e way aliments of the rich,
which fill them with fiery juices, and bri
ng on indigestions, the unwholesome food of the
poor, of which even, bad as it is, they very often fall short, and the want of which tempts
them, every opportunity that offers, to
eat greedily and overload their stomachs;
watchings, excesses of every ki
nd, immoderate transports of
all the passions, fatigues,
waste of spirits, in a word, the numberl
ess pains and anxietie
s annexed to every
condition, and which the mind of man is constan
tly a prey to; these are the fatal proofs
that most of our ills are of our own making,
and that we might have avoided them all by
adhering to the simple, uniform and solitary
way of life prescrib
ed to us by nature.
Allowing that nature intended we should alwa
ys enjoy good health, I dare almost affirm
that a state of reflection is a state against
nature, and that the man who meditates is a
depraved animal. We need only call to mind th
e good constitution of savages, of those at
least whom we have not destroyed by our str
ong liquors; we need onl
y reflect, that they
are strangers to almost ever
y disease, except t
hose occasioned by wound
s and old age, to
be in a manner convinced that
the history of human diseas
es might be easily composed
by pursuing that of civil socie
ties. Such at least was the op
inion of Plato, who concluded
from certain remedies made use of or approv
ed by Podalyrus and Macaon at the Siege of
Troy, that several disorders, which these re
medies were found to bring on in his days,
were not known among men at that remote period.
Man therefore, in a state of nature where th
ere are so few sources of sickness, can have
no great occasion for physic, and still less fo
r physicians; neither is the human species
more to be pitied in this respect, than a
ny other species of animals. Ask those who make
hunting their recreation or busines
s, if in their excursions they meet with many sick or
feeble animals. They meet with many carry
ing the marks of cons
iderable wounds, that
have been perfectly well healed and closed
up; with many, whose bones formerly broken,
and whose limbs almost torn off, have completely knit and united, without any other
surgeon but time, any other regimen but thei
r usual way of living, and whose cures were
not the less perfect for their not having been
tortured with incisions
, poisoned with drugs,
or worn out by diet and abstinence. In
a word, however useful medicine well
administered may be to us who live in a stat
e of society, it is st
ill past doubt, that if, on
the one hand, the sick savage, destitute of
help, has nothing to hope
from nature, on the
other, he has nothing to
fear but from his disease; a ci
rcumstance, which oftens renders
his situation preferable to ours.
Let us therefore beware of confounding sava
ge man with the men, whom we daily see
and converse with. Nature behaves towards
all animals left to her care with a
predilection, that seems to pr
ove how jealous she is of that
prerogative. The horse, the
cat, the bull, nay the ass itself, have generally
a higher stature, and always a more robust
constitution, more vigour, more strength and c
ourage in their forests than in our houses;
they lose half these advantages by becoming domestic animals; it looks as if all our
attention to treat them kindly, a
nd to feed them well, served only to bastardize them. It is
thus with man himself. In proportion as he
becomes sociable and a slave to others, he
becomes weak, fearful, mean-spirited, and his
soft and effeminate
way of living at once
completes the enervation of his strength and
of his courage. We may add, that there must
be still a wider difference betw
een man and man in a savage and domestic condition, than
between beast and beast; for as men and beasts
have been treated alike by nature, all the
conveniences with which men indulge themselves
more than they do
the beasts tamed by
them, are so many particular causes which make them degenerate more sensibly.
Nakedness therefore, the want of houses, an
d of all these unnecessaries, which we
consider as so very necessary, are not such mighty evils in respect to these primitive men,
and much less still any obstacle to their preser
vation. Their skins, it is
true, are destitute
of hair; but then they have no occasion for any such covering in warm climates; and in
cold climates they soon learn to apply to
that use those of the animals they have
conquered; they have but two feet to run
with, but they have
two hands to defend
themselves with, and provide for all their want
s; it costs them perhaps a great deal of time
and trouble to make their children walk, but the mothers carry them with ease; an
advantage not granted to other
species of animals, with wh
om the mother, when pursued,
is obliged to abandon her young ones, or regulate
her steps by theirs. In short, unless we
admit those singular and fortuitous concurren
ces of circumstances, which I shall speak of
hereafter, and which, it is very possible, may never have existed, it is evident, in every
state of the question, that the man, who firs
t made himself clothes and built himself a
cabin, supplied himself with things which he
did not much want, since he had lived
without them till then; and why should he not ha
ve been able to support in his riper years,
the same kind of life, which he had supported from his infancy?
Alone, idle, and always surrounded with danger,
savage man must be fond of sleep, and
sleep lightly like other animals, who think bu
t little, and may, in a manner, be said to
sleep all the time they do not think: self-pre
servation being almost his only concern, he
must exercise those faculties most, which are most serviceable in attacking and in
defending, whether to subdue his prey, or to pr
event his becoming that of other animals:
those organs, on the contrary, which softne
ss and sensuality can alone improve, must
remain in a state of rudeness, utterly incompa
tible with all manner of
delicacy; and as his
senses are divided on this poi
nt, his touch and hi
s taste must be extremely coarse and
blunt; his sight, his hearing, and his smelling eq
ually subtle: such is the animal state in
general, and accordingly if we may believe trav
ellers, it is that of most savage nations.
We must not therefore be surprised, that
the Hottentots of the
Cape of Good Hope,
distinguish with their naked eyes ships on the
ocean, at as great a distance as the Dutch
can discern them with their glasses; nor that
the savages of America should have tracked
the Spaniards with thei
r noses, to as great a degree of
exactness, as the best dogs could
have done; nor that all these
barbarous nations support nake
dness without pain, use such
large quantities of Piemento to give their f
ood a relish, and drink li
ke water the strongest
liquors of Europe.
As yet I have considered man merely in hi
s physical capacity; let
us now endeavour to
examine him in a metaphysical and moral light.
I can discover nothing in any me
re animal but an ingenious m
achine, to which nature has
given senses to wind itself up, and guard, to
a certain degree, against everything that
might destroy or disorder it. I perceive the ve
ry same things in the human machine, with
this difference, that nature alone operates in all the operations of the beast, whereas man,
as a free agent, has a share in his. One chooses
by instinct; the othe
r by an act of liberty;
for which reason the beast cannot deviate from th
e rules that have been prescribed to it,
even in cases where such deviation might be
useful, and man often deviates from the
rules laid down for him to his prejudice. Thus
a pigeon would starve
near a dish of the
best flesh-meat, and a cat on a
heap of fruit or corn, though
both might very well support
life with the food which they thus disdain, did
they but bethink themselves to make a trial
of it: it is in this manner dissolute men run into excesses, which bring on fevers and death
itself; because the mind depraves the senses,
and when nature ceases to speak, the will
still continues to dictate.
All animals must be allowed to have ideas,
since all animals have senses; they even
combine their ideas to a certain degree, and,
in this respect, it is only the difference of
such degree, that constitutes the differen
ce between man and beast: some philosophers

Ten Ways To Greater Self Esteem
Forward
Hi, I have worked in the field of counselling and coaching for some time now, and I am always
amazed at the God given ability we humans have to improve our lives for the better. There
has been great philosophical debate throughout the centuries, as to 'why we are here', and
'what life is about'. In simple terms, people of all walks of life have fundamentally come to the
same conclusion. That is, we are here to make what we can of life, to lead meaningful
relationships, to reproduce, and master areas of our own choice. Happiness is an achievement
we can come to know and love, through improving our thoughts and beliefs about the world
and each other.
Maybe you are reading this book because you wish to improve your own self esteem, if so I am
quite sure the things you shall learn about will help you greatly. Maybe you are reading this
book because you have things going on in your life which you are struggling with. If this is the
case then please do read on, as I know the ideas you will get from this book will have some
benefit to you both emotionally and psychologically. Or, maybe you are reading this book
because you want to feel better today. While I can not promise immediate relief from inner
burdens, I can ensure you that if you are to take some of the ideas in this book and practice
them like you would a hobby, self esteem will happen for you

So. . . . What Is Self Esteem?
Put simply, self esteem is a person's own evaluation of themselves psychologically, emotionally,
physically, and spiritually. Self esteem is mainly about the worth we give ourselves, how much
we like ourselves, and how well we feel about ourselves. Self esteem is something we have
internalized over time, and has often been influenced by other sources such as friends, family,
and any significant other figures in our lives. If a person is told that they are 'not good
enough' over a certain period of time by a close one; or colleague; or teacher for example; it is
likely this person will to some extent have believed the criticism as 'truth'. We can often be
tricked into thinking rich and successful people have undoubtedly got the highest levels of self
esteem. This however is an illusion. Our lives can be broken down into different categories
and, while career; wealth; and status are three particular categories; self esteem may be
lacking in family, relationship, and health categories for example. We are all human, so it
follows that our self esteem will fluctuate throughout the different changes and challenges we
meet.
So. . . . Why Is Self Esteem Important?
Self esteem is important because it gives you the piece of mind you need to appreciate your
own life and the lives of others. Self esteem, brings a person joy; confidence; well being; and
wholeness. A person with a good level of self esteem, has the ability to live life joyfully
regardless of set backs. The good news is, improving self esteem is easy when a person realizes

Tip 1 Access The Power Of Your
Subconscious Mind
“You effect the unconscious mind through verbal
repetition” Clement Stone
Most people go through life without having any knowledge of an amazing intelligence born in to us
all as a precious gift, which allows us to use our minds to create what we want. Our conscious
minds are involved in processing our conscious thoughts through our sensory perceptive systems.
What ever we touch, feel, smell, taste, see, or hear will be processed through our conscious minds.
So while eating a favorite food we are consciously aware that the food tastes nice, and we begin to
tell our subconscious mind how wonderful the food is by continually affirming it verbally, and
through taste and smell.
WHATEVER WE CONTINUE TO TELL OUR SUBCONSCIOUS
MIND, OUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND WILL DIGEST AND MAKE TRUTH OF.
So, in simple terms, one sure way to increase self esteem which has been proven to work, is to
continually practice verbal affirmations which lead our subconscious minds into happiness. Now. . .
lets think about this logically and simply. Low self esteem is a result of the subconscious mind
being fed with negative and defeating beliefs such as:
I CAN'T, I'M USELESS, I WILL NEVER
DO IT, NOBODY LIKES ME, I'M SO ANGRY, I'M SO DEPRESSED, LIFE SUCKS. (THE
LIST GOES ON).
The subconscious mind is all powerful, it is working while we are asleep and awake. It is designed
for us to lead satisfying lives, and has been responsible for the great creations of mankind.
However, far too many of us, struggling in our day to day lives have not come to understand how
we can use it for it's good. And. . . believe me, the subconscious mind is amazing in ensuring our
well being in body, mind and soul. It is responsible for all unconscious processes such as heart beat
and hair growth. It heals our wounds, reproduces our cells, and grants us unlimited creativity.
So, here is the key to improving self esteem through the subconscious mind. Follow my instruction,
personalize it to your own needs, practice the exercise daily, twice daily, or thrice daily and notice
great results:
+
Find a quiet place to relax alone, a comfy space where you are not likely to be disturbed.
Do not try this exercise while driving or operating machinery.
+
Sit or lie comfortably, and if possible set the scene with some nice quiet relaxation music
(there is loads on the internet).
+
Focus on your breathing, breath through the diaphragm by pumping your tummy out like a
balloon as you breath in, holding it for five seconds, then breathing out again, do this
continually.
+
Visualize being on a nice beach with sunshine beating down, and notice how relaxed you
are. Be aware still of your breathing and its calming effect on your body.
+
Repeat the following words “ I'm feeling good, I feel relaxed, I like myself in all situations”
repeat this ten times as a kind of lullaby.
+
Step six: repeat the following words “ My joy is within me, I like myself in every way, I'm
strong”
+
repeat this ten times as a lullaby. Create new and personal affirmations for your mind..
Always remember the infinite wisdom of the subconscious mind is a source of divine energy which
can be tapped into at any time. Always feed your subconscious mind with positive healthy thoughts
by affirming positive phrases. Likewise create nice vivid images in your mind of beautiful scenes,
look regularly at sunsets, clouds, trees, and lakes or rivers. These images are great for the mind!!

Tip 2 Practice The Art Of Good Deeds, Good
Find's Good.
“Goodness Is The Only Investment That Never Fails” Thoreau
Many of us, lose track of feeling good about ourselves, because we lead busy demanding lifestyles.
Some of us are that busy doing things for others that we end up feeling burnt out an unappreciated.
Some of us, are that busy trying to meet a deadline or finish a project, that we lose valuable time
with family and friends. Then there are some of us, who are so burdened with current worries,
problems, and setbacks, that we seem to lack in appreciation of ourselves and who we really are.
Self esteem can reach different points in different areas of our lives, and is a very internal concept.
By this I mean that we might try hard to create an image of ourselves as having great esteem, when
really inside we are aware of quite the contrary. Take for example a look at our Hollywood stars, or
indeed our great British pop idols. In this current age of multi media, some of us actually find
entertainment in noticing the unhappiness in these rich successful stars. The truth is, self esteem has
nothing to do with what we have physically, or materially, but is more to do with what is going on
in our hearts and minds.
If you want to start feeling good in your life
START BY INWARDLY CREATING SOME
GOOD THINGS YOU CAN DO IN EVERY AREA OF YOUR LIFE AS FROM TODAY!
THEN ACT ON THESE IDEAS.
I don't want this to sound daunting, or too much like hard work, and, I'm not asking you to become
a miracle worker. To embark on this new mini project, we simply set ourselves some small
achievable tasks which hold the same end result
YOU WILL FEEL GOOD!
Here is what I did when I embarked on this mini project for the first time. I was reluctant to to try it,
but believe me the end result was amazing. My self esteem went 'through the roof' and I felt great.
My Plan was as follows. . . . please create your own. Three good things a day will suffice (oh. . .
and don't tell anybody about your good deeds!)
+
Exchange greetings with a stranger, comment on what a beautiful day it is
+
Pay a friend/colleague a compliment on how well they look today (and mean it)
+
Take a bag of goods to a local charity shop and don't tell anyone (this is important)
+
Pick litter up on the local play area where my son plays regularly
+
Empathize with the lady in the shop who is going through a rocky divorce
+
Congratulate the next door neighbor who just found a job.
+
Smile at passer by who you find particularly attractive.
Please, only see my action plan as something I needed to do to create some 'goodness' in my life,
the idea is for you to recognize that you can incorporate small and simple things into your own life,
to create inner feelings of self worth. It can be as simple as offering a warm smile to a passer by,
thanking a shopkeeper for a kind service, or picking up the phone and telling a distant relative that
you miss them. Start now creating goodness! And enjoy the results. And. . . . remember to tap into
your subconscious mind, by becoming relaxed and asking it to provide you with the means to create
new ideas around 'good' things.

Tip 3 Activate Your Positive Chemicals.
Think And Feel Better.
“Movement is a medicine for creating change
in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states” Carol Welch.
You are probably well aware of the term 'endorphin' which relates to our amazing process of
creating natural innate opiates as a result of doing a physical activity we enjoy. We all have within
us this ability to produce positive chemicals in our minds which will lead us to a great sense of
serenity and joy.
The foods we eat and the drinks we consume also have an effect on the way we feel. However, for
many of us, the thought of eating lot's of healthy vegetables, fish, and wholegrain foods seems more
of a burden than a pleasure. Likewise, to many of us, the thought of engaging in some good
physical exercise seems daunting and overwhelming. However this needn't be the reality.
If you are not getting any regular exercise, start to list down on a piece of paper some activities you
could start doing lightly. This does not have to be a costly affair, It also does not have to take up a
great deal of your time. It does however, have to be something you can realistically achieve.
Your
self esteem levels will immediately soar, as you embark on a small physical activity which you
can achieve.
To the beginner, the activity could be something as simple as taking a walk around the block. If you
are lucky enough to have a safe, populated park nearby, you could also consider listening to a
personal stereo. This needs to be risk assessed however. It is more safe and sensible to exercise
while listening to music, in a light, safe place such as a gym, or a staffed park. Music and exercise
bring more vibration to your own natural rhythm. This can have a profound effect on your mental
and physical response which is highly influenced by a rush of endorphins.
Please do not be put off by the thought of exercise as a means to building your self esteem. There
are some of us who can not physically walk or do any form of physical exercise, due to sickness or
disability. However, finding something which enables you to be creative in someway is also a
means to get in touch with those positive chemicals which will lead to higher levels of self esteem.
Follow these steps in creating achievable self esteem boosting activities:
+
Pick an activity of your choice, anything which you feel interested in or passionate about
which is achievable for example: walking;jogging;writing;painting;cooking;music
+
Carry out some research on your chosen activity, visit places where you can practice your
activity, use the local library/internet for tips on improving your activity
+
talk to like minded people who enjoy the same activity as you.
+
Use your chosen activity as your own bit of space, notice the positive responses you
experience while doing the activity.
+
Increase the frequency of the activity, make it a priority and a common habit, by doing this,
higher self esteem will become a common response
Once you come to understand the simplicity of boosting your own self esteem by practicing
activities which help you to feel good, you will gain a greater sense of self. The key is to start small
and reward yourself accordingly. Whether you have walked the block; or written a poem; run a
marathon or climbed a mountain, be sure to reward yourself with something you deserve.

Tip 4 Develop An Attitude Of Gratitude
“To speak gratitude is courteous and pleasant, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live
gratitude is to touch heaven” Johannes A Gaertner.
Ask yourself the question “How grateful am I?” and then listen to yourself being as truthful as you
can. Having worked with many wonderful clients over the years, many have struggled to list ten
things they could be grateful for in their lives. So, I challenge you right now. Take a pen and some
paper and jot down ten things you really have to be grateful for, these could be things from the past
or the present. How easy is it for you to do this exercise? Did the ten things come to you
immediately, or, did you struggle consciously recollecting them?
Gratitude and being thankful for what we have, what we love, our special gifts both materially and
spiritually, is a positive attitude which has an amazing effect on our level of self esteem. The truth
of the matter is, you do have something to be grateful for if you will be open enough to allow it.
Many of us have a human tendency to focus hard on what we don't like in our lives, we are
determined to dwell on things which cause us anger, hostility, frustration, and shame. Much of this
can be to do with our past experiences. We have been so overwhelmed by something 'bad' which
happened in our earlier days, that we continually tarnish our current experience with negativity.
When you decide to be grateful for the things you have, you are making a conscious decision to like
and appreciate these things. This immediately evokes a sense of joy and contentment which will add
to your measure of self esteem. Many of us take for granted the beauty of a day, the blessing of
good health, strengths and attributes, loved ones, material possessions, and the free will to choose
our own life path.
Many of us take for granted the flow of running water, heated homes, comfy beds, and an endless
supply of the foods of our choice. The Victorians would be a very confused people if they were to
glance into their future and see mankind in this twenty first century. They would see our advanced
technology, our abundance of nice foods and clothes, an elaborate welfare state, and cures to many
killer diseases. Then they would see alongside these great things, the doom and gloom, the tension
and stress, and the general pessimism of the today's people.
Being grateful about the little things in your life is the start to creating a greater sense of inner
gratitude which will lead to greater self esteem. To many, it will seem like an unusual concept, to
some it will seem abnormal. Many choose to be ungrateful and meet with frustration, want, and
discontentment. You can begin right now to develop an attitude of gratitude:
+
As day dawns or night draws in, look to the skies and their beauty. Look at the trees and the
different colors and in your mind say thank you for the day. Use your heart to really express
the gratitude, take deep breaths and relax into the gratitude
+
Think about a loved one and the imprint they have had on your life, those happy times, their
unique character and beauty. In your mind say thank you for this person. E.g “I'm so grateful
for Fred and the laughter he gives me so often”
+
Think about your 47 inch LCD television with Dolby surround. Think of the impact this has
on your enjoyment of films and programmes. Start to say thanks for the great quality of
picture and sound you regularly experience.
+
Think about a difficult time when you were unsure how things were going to pan out. A time
where you felt all alone. Be grateful for the fact you came through it and the strength you
have now gained as a result
+
Be grateful for the small things, a friendly greeting from a stranger, the peace of a nice quiet
place, a new person who has come into your life, or the relief of a person who has left .
REMEMBER GRATITUDE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN BEGIN TO DEVELOP
RIGHT NOW. IT REALLY WILL LIFT YOUR SELF ESTEEM!

Tip 5 Visualize Your Way To Self Esteem
“Visualize the thing that you want, see it, feel it, believe in it, mark your mental blue print, and
begin to build” Robert Collier
Are you aware of the power of your mind and nervous system? Did you know you have the ability
to experience anything you wish to just by visualizing. Well, to start with then, close your eyes and
imagine standing in front of a rose garden, as you look at the roses you can see their vivid colors,
smell their fragrant smells, and feel a summer breeze. So. . . how was that? Did you find the colors
came easily, the fragrance easily, and the feel of the summer breeze quite real? If you did, you have
just proven to yourself that you can create any experience you want by using your own mind. If you
did not find it so easy, do not be disheartened. Visualization is a skill which can be learned by us all,
and gets easier and easier the more we practice it.
It is important to learn to get into relaxed states of consciousness when visualizing. A nice quiet
place in a safe environment is key. Many of us again, have a tendency to visualize on negative
things, which is not good for us, as we immediately experience the feelings and emotions we attach
to those negative things. Some of us wake up in the morning in a state of fear, dread, frustration, or
fatigue. The very thought of a new day can seem like quite a burden. Some of us wish the day had
ended before it began. Ever had that? I know I have had many a waking experience like this. The
good news is that,
ONCE YOU REALISE THAT YOU CAN VISUALISE A POSITIVE VIEW
OF YOUR DAY, MORE SATISFYING RESULTS WILL FOLLOW.
Lets think about this for a moment. Can anybody else influence the way you choose to think and
feel? Can your boss decide how you will think and feel? Can your friend? Can your enemy? Can a
Hollywood movie star? I'm going to ask this question in a similar way now: Do you let anybody
else influence the way you chose to think and feel? The truth is
ONLY YOU DECIDE HOW YOU
WANT TO THINK AND FEEL.
Some of us go through pretty rough times when we are faced with situations in which we have to
engage with others who annoy and frustrate us. We can easily lose track of who we are, and our self
esteem can lower as we struggle with feelings of anger and hostility. It is during these times
visualization can be of a great benefit to us. Here's something you can begin today! Start making
visualization a part of your life. Enjoy it like a hobby and reap the benefits of a greater self esteem
follow this simple example exercise
+
Nominate a quiet room where you will not be disturbed, select some nice relaxation music,
use cushions and either sit in lotus position or lie comfortably on your back.
+
Take some nice slow deep breaths and close your eyes, as you inhale utter the words peace
and light, as you exhale feel the tension go out of your body
+
Now imagine viewing your day on a big movie screen,each part of the day fragmented into
chapters. Picture bright colors. See yourself upon that screen full of calmness and peace.
Imagine that you are smiling as you go to your first destination
+
Now still being aware of your breathing, look up at the screen and notice yourself full of
laughter, excitement, and peace of mind
+
feel in your body these great feelings of peace of mind, fun, and confidence
+
Make the pictures on the movie screen brighter, and the good feelings you have stronger and
stronger
+
Now imagine, all things throughout your day turning out positive, don't be afraid, see these
positive things happening upon that screen, and feel the joy and greatness of the day
+
BE AWARE THAT YOU CREATE YOUR OWN REALITY THROUGH YOUR OWN
MIND, YOU CAN ACCESS FEELINGS OF PEACE, CALM, JOY, AND STRENGTH
WHENEVER YOU CHOOSE.
Practice positive visualization daily and reap the benefits of a greater self esteem

Tip 6 Live A Life Of Laughter
“Laughter Is The Best Medicine” Proverb
Laughter has a great impact on our self esteem levels. Some of us move within social circles where
laughter is commonplace. Laughter is undoubtedly healthy and scientists have proven that laughter
is linked to happiness. Dr Robert Holden in his happiness experiment, highlighted that when
combined with exercise, and positive thinking, laughter would create great happiness in people.
How much laughter do you have in your life at present? Are you mixing with people who laugh
lots. Do you watch any television which provides you with the entertainment to lead you toward
laughter. One step you can take right now, is to keep a laughter journal. Please, do consider this as
an active way to improve your self esteem. Carry with you a small note pad and record how many
times a day you laugh. Be your own researcher and act as your own laughter consultant. Do you
have a favorite comedian or comedy actor? If so start to watch more films/programmes with your
favorite comedy sketches on. Do you watch much television at present? If so start to cut out things
which will bring you doom and gloom. Stop watching the news, documentaries based on crime, and
soaps where deceit and hatred are the drama. Instead, explore when you can watch pure comedy
shows which are your preferential choice. With our modern T.V technology, you might even be able
to store your favorites and watch them as you like.
You are an amazing person, and once you come to understand that you can control all aspects of
your life, you will start to notice better levels of self esteem. Control your ability to increase the
amount of fun you have. The more childlike you can be, the more creative you can become.
Children are always laughing, they are innocent to the negative ways of the world. They are seldom
interest in international conflicts, local newspaper headlines which promote fear, or general
negativity. Children can teach adults lots about they way we could improve our lives. Laughter is a
great example of this. Learn to laugh more, and if you think you are a great laugher, then approach
someone else and tell them your secrets. Laughter is an instant vacation from fears and sorrows.
Laughter is universal, it is custom to all nationalities. Laughter brings us hope and happiness.
Do not attempt the following exercise if you have a heart condition!
Here's an exercise you can try, to help get you in the habit of laughing more:
+
Forced laughter tricks the mind into real laughter from the heart, so start now to force a
chuckle using the following: ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho. And again he he he he he he he he
+
Don't feel silly but continue each ho an he 8 times per breath:ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho then
he he he he he he he he
+
Now give it some more well really go to town bring it up from the tummy: ho ho ho ho ho
ho ho ho and again really power it he he he he he he he he
+
Continue this for five minutes and notice how real laughter will follow each time. This is
actually good for you and can influence better sleeping patterns
+
While you may feel silly, practice this exercise regularly when you are alone, or with a good
friend/partner who you will not feel silly with.
+
Learn to laugh passionately and from the heart
Make laughter a hobby, remember that forced laughter tricks the mind into activating real hearty
laughter which is good for the soul “Laugh And The World Laughs With You” and you gain great
self esteem.

Tip7 Become Your Own Best Friend
“Love yourself
first and everything falls into line” Lucille Ball
How much do you like yourself at the moment? Find a quiet place and ask yourself this question
and see what answers you immediately come up with. Now, building on that question how much do
you love yourself? Daft as it may sound, these two questions will provide you with relevant answers
as to the measure of self esteem you are experiencing in your life at present.
Some of us are not clear what love is, and we all have our own definition of the meaning of love.
Many of us find it easy to love others, but, due to unresolved inner conflicts, we struggle to love
ourselves. There has been much debate over the true meaning of loving oneself. Some of us who
struggle with the idea of putting ourselves first, take on the role of martyr, doing everything we can
to please others, but ending up feeling burnt out and frustrated. In contrast, some of us find it very
difficult to empathize with anyone else, and due to our own fears and insecurities we go out of our
way to only please ourselves.
The best way toward great self esteem is to treat yourself as your own best friend. This does not
mean that you lack in the capacity of offering love, humility, and compassion to others. No, it
means that you learn to love yourself so much, that this abundance of love pours out to friends,
family, colleagues, and strangers.
In order to love yourself more from this very moment you need to understand a basic truth:
YOU
ARE AN AMAZING CREATION WITH GREAT POWER AND ABILITY. YOU HAVE
GREAT RICHES OF TALLENT WITHIN YOU AND YOU CAN FIND THIS AND GIVE IT
FREELY TO THE WORLD
I'm not just making this up, this stuff is real whether you like it or not. I'm sure many of you reading
this will know straight away about the great talents you have been blessed with. So, given that you
are amazing (And you are. . . You really are), start today to give yourself the love and appreciation
you deserve. Become your own best friend. A true best friend will defend you when you are unfairly
criticized by others, they will forgive you when you make mistakes, they will celebrate your
successes, and ease your burden when you cry. This is what you need to do for yourself.
Forgive yourself, again, and, again, and again, if you are critical of yourself or feeling guilty be
aware of this. Try and immediately create a thought which is not self blaming. If you have let
yourself down in someway, forgive yourself and draw a line under it. Guilt provides us with a
lesson from which we can learn to adjust. Think about times you have forgiven others, the power
that this forgiveness had on that other person and yourself. Think of yourself from this moment
forward as your own best friend. Encourage your friend to try new things, defend your friend from
the undue criticisms of others. Use your subconscious mind (see Tip 1) to start using positive
dialog with yourself. Heres an exercise you can use to start liking yourself more:
+
Fix an appointment with yourself which cannot be broken, your best friend(yourself) is
counting on you to attend . Write the appointment down and stick to it under all costs
+
Plan what the appointment is going to be, something which will be good for you, which you
can enjoy soberly and do alone. Pamper yourself, take a swim, or visit the cinema, walk in
some nice landscape, anything which feels healthy and good to you!
+
Learn to enjoy your own company, talk to yourself (in your head, you might feel silly doing
it out loud) and use appreciative dialog
+
Relax Relax Relax, enjoy every moment of this appointment with yourself and be aware of
your inner voice, a voice which likes and loves you.
+
Feel the benefits of having piece of mind, be aware of how you can benefit others through
your grounded reliance in yourself
A great way to self esteem is buy becoming your own best friend. Learn the art of discipline, by
working at knowing yourself better and better.
